# Lintament VS Code Extension

An LLM-powered linter that replaces bad code with ancient wisdom. Because sometimes, the best fix is philosophical acceptance.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Judgment**: Analyzes your code for spiritual weakness and lack of discipline
- **Ancient Wisdom**: Replace technical debt with philosophical debt
- **Zero Learning Curve**: If you can read, you can be enlightened
- **Instant Enlightenment**: Bad code is simply removed from existence

## Commands

- **Judge Current File**: Analyze and fix the currently open file
- **Judge Entire Workspace**: Analyze all files in your workspace
- **Consult the Ancients**: Get wisdom about selected code
- **Regress**: Undo the last fix (cowardice mode)

## Configuration

Open VS Code settings and search for "Lintament" to configure:

- `lintament.wisdomLevel`: Level of judgment (`gentle`, `firm`, `maximum`, `ruthless`)
- `lintament.mercyMode`: Set to true if you are emotionally fragile
- `lintament.quoteSource`: Source of wisdom (`sun-tzu`, `marcus-aurelius`, `confucius`, `your-disappointed-father`)
- `lintament.judgmentThreshold`: How bad code must be before replacement (0-1)
- `lintament.preserveComments`: Whether to preserve comments (default: false)
- `lintament.apiKey`: OpenAI API key for LLM analysis (optional, uses heuristics if not provided)
- `lintament.model`: OpenAI model to use (default: `gpt-4`)

## Philosophy

> "To refactor is human; to delete is divine." — The Lintament Manifesto

Modern software development is a chaotic mess of dependencies, technical debt, and "temporary" fixes that become permanent. We believe that the only way to truly fix code is to destroy it.
